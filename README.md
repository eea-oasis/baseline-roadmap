# Welcome to the baseline-roadmap

**The baseline-roadmap repo has been archived as agreed upon by the TSC, Core Devs, and Outreach Teams. Baseline repos will be added as a deliverable in the main repo going forward, with working groups utilizing the corresponding repos and google drives for the tracking of their work.**

This repo provides visibility into the baseline protocol activities and expected timelines through epics and issues organized via ZenHub. This repo is linked to the [baseline protocol](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline) code repo so issues there will show up here as well. If you do not already have the ZenHub plugin for Github, you can find instructions for how to use it [here](https://github.com/marketplace/zenhub).

## Navigating the roadmap

If you click on the `Issues` tab, you will only see a single list of individual issues. However, if you click on the `ZenHub` tab, you will get a better view of where those issues fit in relation to each other and when they are expected to be completed.

### ZenHub Board

Once in the `ZenHub` tab, there is a menu on the side panel. Click on the `Board` view. The issues and epics shown in this view are divided into the following categories:

- **New Epics**: default bucket for epics that have been created but not yet assigned to Icebox, Backlog, or In-Progress Epics
- **New Issues**: default bucket for issues that have been created but not yet assigned to Icebox, Backlog, or In-Progress Epics
- **Icebox**: tasks that we are aware of but are not on the roadmap for the foreseeable future
- **Backlog**: tasks that "up next" after some of the "In-Progress" Epics/Issues are completed
- **In-Progress Epics**: epics that have started and are actively being worked on
- **In-Progress Issues**: issues that are actively being worked on
- **Review/QA**: issues/epics that assignee has completed, but still needs review from the maintainers/community
- **Organizational Issues**: logs that are meant to preserve history, such as meeting minutes or reference material
- **Closed**: issues/epics that are fully completed and merged into the repo, or ones that were scrapped

### ZenHub Roadmap

Similary to the `Board` view, there is a `Roadmap` view in the side panel. This gives the highest level view of the baseline project. The hierarchy shown here is: Projects --> Epics --> Issues. Projects are simply labels that categorize Epics. The timeline shows estimated start and end dates for each epic. The timeline is not a strict deadline, but more of a guideline so the community knows when to roughly expect new features.
